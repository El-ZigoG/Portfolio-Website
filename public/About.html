  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Lesego Gaborone</strong> — a Biomedical Engineering graduate from Wits University
    with a passion for technology, innovation, and problem-solving. My background combines 
    engineering design, programming, and data-driven thinking, allowing me to approach challenges 
    from both a technical and creative perspective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over the past few years, I’ve built a range of projects — from <strong>C++ games</strong> and 
    <strong>Arduino-based medical prototypes</strong> to <strong>data analysis tools in MATLAB and R</strong>.
    Now, I’m expanding my skills into the world of <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> and 
    <strong>Web Development</strong>, learning how to design and deploy scalable, modern digital solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mission is simple: to use technology to make meaningful impact — whether by helping 
    small businesses move online, or by developing smarter systems 
    that improve everyday life. This portfolio showcases my journey and the projects I’ve built along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Feel free to explore my work, connect with me, or collaborate on something that brings 
    positive change through technology.
